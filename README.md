## Import Aliasing (`@`)

This project uses the `@` symbol as a path alias to refer to the `/src` folder. This makes imports cleaner and easier to manage:

### Instead of:

```ts
import LoginScreen from "../../../screens/LoginScreen";
import { colors } from "../../../constants/colors";
```

### You can write:

```ts
import LoginScreen from "@screens/LoginScreen";
import { colors } from "@utils";
```
