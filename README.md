## Import Aliasing (`@`)

This project uses the `@` symbol as a path alias to refer to the `/src` folder. This makes imports cleaner and easier to manage.

üìñ **Learn more**: [Babel Module Resolver](https://github.com/tleunen/babel-plugin-module-resolver) | [TypeScript Path Mapping](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/module-resolution.html#path-mapping)

### Instead of:

```ts
import LoginScreen from "../../../screens/LoginScreen";
import { colors } from "../../../constants/colors";
```

### You can write:

```ts
import LoginScreen from "@screens/LoginScreen";
import { colors } from "@utils";
```

## Best Practices for an Expo React Native Project

To ensure this project is maintainable, scalable, and efficient, here‚Äôs how I recommend you work with it:

### 1. **Organize Your Work**

- Stick to the existing folder structure. For example, place reusable components in `/src/components` and keep screen-specific logic in `/src/screens`.
- When adding new features, group related files together. For instance, if you create a new screen, include its styles and any custom hooks in the same directory.

### 2. **Use TypeScript Effectively**

- Always define types and interfaces for props, state, and API responses. This will help you catch errors early and make the code easier to understand.
- If you‚Äôre unsure about a type, check the `/src/types` folder or create a new type definition there.

### 3. **Build Reusable Components**

- When creating UI elements, think about whether they can be reused elsewhere. If so, add them to `/src/components`.
- Keep each component focused on a single responsibility to make it easier to maintain and test.

### 4. **Manage State Wisely**

- For simple state needs, use the Context API or hooks in `/src/hooks`.

### 5. **Focus on Performance**

- Use `React.memo` for components that don‚Äôt need to re-render often.
- Optimize images by compressing them or using Expo‚Äôs `ImageManipulator`.
- Avoid inline styles; instead, use `StyleSheet.create` for better performance.
- Use arrow functions to make the styles, and use it in the screen.

### 6. **Handle Errors Proactively**

- Think in every single error that can cause the logic, and handle it.

### 7. **[Write Clean Code](#how-to-code)**

- Use Prettier and ESLint to keep the codebase consistent. The project already includes configurations for these tools.
- Use early returns when is possible [Early returns](#early-returns).
- Follow the naming conventions used in the project to maintain readability.

### 8. **Test Your Code**

- Write unit tests for new components and utilities.
- When you finish coding, test the app by web and android, ensuring the code is well done.

### 9. **Secure Sensitive Data**

- Store sensitive information like tokens securely using `expo-secure-store`.
- All sensitive data, will be managed by the backend ([server](#project-structure)).

### 10. **Work with Git**

- Commit changes frequently with clear messages. For example, ‚ÄúAdd login screen‚Äù is better than ‚ÄúFix stuff.‚Äù
- Use feature branches for new functionality and merge them into the main branch via pull requests.

- üìñ **Git Best Practices**: [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) | [Git Flow](https://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/)

### 11. **Keep Dependencies Updated**

- Regularly check for updates to the [Expo SDK](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/upgrading-expo-sdk-walkthrough/) and other dependencies. Run `npx expo install --check` to see what's available (**TIP**: Do not use this with all your changes).
- After updating, test the app thoroughly to ensure everything works as expected. medication schedules, track adherence, and receive timely reminders through an intelligent pillbox integration.

# How to code

## Early returns

Try using early returns where is possible, it is also possible with for

**Instead of**

```typescript
const canLogin = (username: string, password: string): boolean => {
  if (username === "user") {
    if (password === "1234") {
      return true;
    }
  }
  return false;
};
```

**Write it like this:**

```typescript
const canLogin = (username: string, password: string): boolean => {
  // This makes the code more readable.
  if (username !== "user") return false;
  if (password !== "1234") return false;

  return true;
};
```

---

## JSDOC

/\*\*

- JSDoc is a standardized way to document JavaScript code. It uses special
- comment syntax to describe the purpose, parameters, return values, and
- other details of functions, classes, and other code elements. These comments
- can be processed by tools to generate documentation or provide in-editor
- assistance.
-
- Key elements of JSDoc:
- - `@param`: Describes a parameter of a function, including its name, type, and purpose.
- - `@returns`: Describes the return value of a function, including its type and purpose.
- - `@type`: Specifies the type of a variable or property.
- - `@example`: Provides an example of how to use the documented code.
- - `@deprecated`: Marks a function or feature as outdated and suggests alternatives.
- Example:

```typescript
/**
 * Adds two numbers together.
 * @param {number} a - The first number.
 * @param {number} b - The second number.
 * @returns {number} The sum of the two numbers.
 * @example
 * log(add(2, 3)); // Outputs: 5
 *
 */
const add = (a: number, b: number): number => a + b;
```

- Using JSDoc improves code readability, maintainability, and helps developers understand the purpose and usage of the code.
- **TIP**: When a function or variable is documented with JSDoc, you can view its documentation by hovering over the function or variable in your code editor. This feature provides quick insights into the purpose, parameters, and return values of the function or variable, enhancing your development experience.

## Arrow Functions

Arrow functions are a concise way to write functions in JavaScript. They are especially useful for writing shorter function expressions and maintaining the `this` context in certain scenarios.

üìñ **Learn more**: [MDN Arrow Functions](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Functions/Arrow_functions) | [JavaScript.info](https://javascript.info/arrow-functions-basics)

### Syntax

An arrow function uses the `=>` syntax:

```javascript
// Traditional function
function add(a, b) {
  return a + b;
}

// Arrow function
const add = (a, b) => a + b;
```

### Key Features

1. **Concise Syntax**  
   Arrow functions allow you to write shorter function expressions. If the function body contains only a single expression, you can omit the braces `{}` and the `return` keyword.

   ```typescript
   // Single-line arrow function
   const square = (x: number): number => x * x;
   ```

2. **Implicit Return**  
   When the function body is a single expression, the result of that expression is implicitly returned.

   ```typescript
   const greet = (name: Exclude<any, Falsy>): string => `Hello, ${name}!`;
   ```

3. **No `this` Binding**  
   Arrow functions do not have their own `this` context. Instead, they inherit `this` from the surrounding scope. This makes them ideal for use in callbacks and event handlers.

   ```javascript
   class Counter {
     count = 0;

     increment = () => {
       this.count++;
     };
   }
   ```

4. **No `arguments` Object**  
   Arrow functions do not have their own `arguments` object. If you need access to `arguments`, use a regular function.

   ```typescript
   const logArgs = (...args) => console.log(args);
   ```

### When to Use Arrow Functions

- For short, simple functions.
- When you need to preserve the `this` context.
- In array methods like `map`, `filter`, and `reduce`.

### When Not to Use Arrow Functions

- When defining methods in a class prototype (use regular functions instead).
- When you need access to the `arguments` object.

---

## Reusability

Everything can be reusable.

For example:

```typescript
const formatPhoneNumber = (phoneNumber: string, countryCode: string) => {
  if (countryCode.toLowerCase() === "mx") {
    return phoneNumber.replace(/(\d{3})(\d{3})(\d{4})/, "$1-$2-$3");
  } else if (countryCode.toLowerCase() === "us") {
    //...
  }
};
```

This function can be use in other parts of the code, this function should be in the file **[/src/utils/functions.ts](#project-structure)**

---

## CamelCase

camelCase is a widely used naming convention in programming where the first word is written in lowercase, and each subsequent word starts with an uppercase letter. This style improves readability and helps distinguish between words in variable, function, and property names.

üìñ **Learn more**: [Naming Conventions](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naming_convention_(programming)>) | [JavaScript Style Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/jsguide.html#naming)

### Examples

```typescript
import { User } from "@types";

// Variable names
let userName: number = "JohnDoe";
let isLoggedIn: boolean = true;

// Function names
const calculateTotal = (price: number, tax: number): number => price + tax;

// Object properties
const user: User = {
  firstName: "John",
  lastName: "Doe",
};
```

### Why Use camelCase?

1. **Readability**  
   camelCase makes it easier to read, write and understand variable and function names, especially when they consist of multiple words.

2. **Consistency**  
   Following a consistent naming convention across your codebase improves maintainability and reduces confusion.

3. **Community Standards**  
   camelCase is the standard naming convention in JavaScript and many other programming languages, making your code more familiar to other developers.

## **Only English**

Write functions, variable names, documentation and any other thing only in english.

üìñ **Why English?**: [Clean Code Principles](https://blog.cleancoder.com/uncle-bob/2012/08/13/the-clean-architecture.html) | [Naming Best Practices](https://refactoring.guru/refactoring/smells/mysterious-name)

**Do not**

```typescript
const nombreDeUsuario: string = "Nico";
/**
 * Suma dos n√∫meros.
 * @param {number} numero1 - El primer numero.
 * @param {number} b - El segundo numero.
 * @returns {number} La suma de los dos n√∫meros.
 * @example
 * log(sumar(2, 3)); // Salida: 5
 *
 */
const sumar = (numero1: number, numero2: number): number => numero1 + numero2;
```

**Use only english**

```typescript
const username: string = "Nico";
/**
 * Adds two numbers together.
 * @param {number} num1 - The first number.
 * @param {number} num2 - The second number.
 * @returns {number} The sum of the two numbers.
 * @example
 * log(add(2, 3)); // Outputs: 5
 *
 */
const add = (num1: number, num2: number): number => num1 + num2;
// or
const addition = (num1: number, num2: number): number => num1 + num2;
```

**If the code is in any other language, the pull request will be reject, even if only one variable name is in another language.**
